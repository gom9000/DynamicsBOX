# DynamicsBOX
This is an open-source, home didactic project, for a *cheap magic box* able to control the volume of two audio lines via an expression/volume pedal.
The pedal wires are decoupled from the audio lines by a digital potentiometer driven by a PIC.
The PIC is programmed to scan at fixed frequency the pedal potentiometer value, then reproduces it on the digital potentiometer wires.
